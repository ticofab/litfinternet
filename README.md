# Litfinternet

Code from my FIRST website ever in 1998.

Back in 1997 I was 16 and the World Wide Web was a new thing. I was also in love with the greatest Italian rock band of all times, named Litfiba.

I decided to create a website about the band. The site would be called "Litfinternet", from Litfiba + Internet.
I remember writing all HTML code by hand in Windows 95's Notepad. No CSS, no Javascript, no PHP. Only HTML.

An Italian ISP named Tiscali was my host of choice: to their absolute credit, the website is still [up and running](http://web.tiscali.it/tifabi/) and is still fully functional,
with the notable exception of a few dynamic services powered by Bravenet, such as a visitor counter and a PHP forum added much later.

The forum became the most important online platform for fans of the band, especially in crucial times when the band split. A lot of work went into moderating the forum,
and despite the earlier trolls (unforgettable people such as Asterix, or a certain Robbie that was an absolute toxic presence), good relationships were forged and it was a lot of fun.
Here's one final message I posted when I shut it down later down the road.

So many memories.
